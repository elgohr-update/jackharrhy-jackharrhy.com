- my 9-5 is building geospatial stuff with [C-CORE](https://c-core.ca/)  
- attending [CTSNL](https://ctsnl.ca/) meetups on thursdays weekly  
- teaching a [Get Coding](https://www.getcoding.ca/) student their module on node  
- filling my [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) instance with many interesting technical feeds; i intend on serving a OPML file from my site someday to share what things i subscribe to  
- been really into solving [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) problems using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) (managed to get #4 on the leaderboard for problem 5!, but problem 6 is taking a toll on me...)  
- remade [yaMUN](https://github.com/jackharrhy/yaMUN) into a library, hoping to document said library, and get things using it (muncs website, discord bot to lookup data, etc.)  
- it has been some time since the launch of [stickertrade](https://stickertrade.ca/), vibes have been good, but i need to dig into more feature work until i onboard more users  
- almost done reading [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-second-edition), has helped out a lot w/Protohackers
